## About the Project

Inspired by Bitcoins blockchain, Concords Ledger is a distributed ledger designed with data portability at its core.

The ledger-web-app runs entirely in the browser, without dependency on a remote server or database. Operations are stored as transactions, directly in the browser on a Proof-Of-Work Blockchain implementation.

Transaction are then executed through lokijs to build a runtime database in the browser to form the application UI and state.
